# Counter-Strike SinglePlayer Campaign
 Some tweaks to play singleplayer (solo missions) in Co-Op Strike of Valve campaigns

- fist, extract the files to csgo/scripts/vscripts/coop/
- extract the cfg file to csgo/cfg (personal bind keys)
- in game, open the terminal and write "exec milton.cfg"

### Note

This isn't a hack of any kind and doesn't' disrupt traditionally multiplayer experience!

# Counter-Strike SinglePlayer Campaign
 Some tweaks to play singleplayer (solo missions) in Co-Op Strike of Valve campaigns

1 - fist, extract the files to csgo/scripts/vscripts/coop/
2 - extract the cfg file to csgo/cfg (personal bind keys)
3 - in game, open the terminal and write "exec milton.cfg"

### Note

This isn't a hack of any kind and doesn't' disrupt traditionally multiplayer experience!
